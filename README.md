# Akshat - BCA Portfolio

### First-Year BCA Student @ Bennett University

Hello! This is a collection of my work as I learn computer science. I'm passionate about applying my classroom skills to real-world projects and am actively seeking a 'core team' to build with.

This repository contains:
* Self-study exercises and projects.
* Solutions to my Python/C++/Web Dev class assignments.
